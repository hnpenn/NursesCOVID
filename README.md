The COVID-19 pandemic has put an unprecedented strain on the healthcare system in the USA.
For our proposed project, our objective is to measure how emotions and morale have changed amongst
nurses before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed this via Reddit data in the major nursing
subreddit (r/nursing) using emotion detection algorithms and topic modeling. Through this process, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the mental strain experienced by nurses as a result of this pandemic.

Overall, we were pleased to find that the results of our modeling aligned with the timeline of
COVID: we started seeing more negative emotions and the COVID topic in our results starting March
2020, we saw the COVID topic, but also more positive emotions, starting November 2020, when
vaccinations drove optimism, and we saw the resurgence of the COVID topic and negative emotions
starting August 2021, potentially suggesting burnout. These results align with the first, third, and fourth
COVID waves in the United States, respectively, validating our work and the modelsâ€™ usefulness.
